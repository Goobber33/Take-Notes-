# Take Notes!

# Description

This application was fun to build. I started with a starter code, and built the server.js file. It uses Express.js to GET POPST and DELETE information and is stored to the server as JSON. It allows you to take notes, save the notes, and access them by simply clicking on the saved note in tbe left side of the page. To add a new note, simply press the plus button. To save a note, when you start typing, a save icon will appear in the top right next to the plus button.
